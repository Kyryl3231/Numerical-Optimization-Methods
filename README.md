# Numerical-Optimization-Methods

This repository is dedicated to numerical optimization methods :magic_wand: :sparkles:.

## Unconstrained Optimization

### Demonstration

To see test results run `python -m unconstrained.test_unconstrained` in the base directory.
Text output will be written to the `unconstrained/test_unconstrained_results.txt`
Graphical representation of the solutions for least square problems can be found at `unconstrained/[optimization_method_name].png` (i.e. `unconstrained/The Steepest Descent.png`)
